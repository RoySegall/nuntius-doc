By Wikipedia, a [Webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) is:
> A webhook in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the 
behavior of a web page, or web application, with custom callbacks. These 
callbacks may be maintained, modified, and managed by third-party users and 
developers who may not necessarily be affiliated with the originating website 
or application.

But, this might not tell you a lot(me either) so I'll give an example.

## Real life example
Let's say you want to know about something that happens at a GitHub repo, a
Docker Hub project or maybe you want to listen to event from you logs service?
With Webhook you can accomplish that. Basically, A Webhook is an HTTP request, 
with a data(payload) or without, which sent to your server from external server.
